ko-stream
=========

Adapt a knockout.js observable to the node.js stream interface.

## Usage

This module extends knockout.js subscribable's fn object with `createStream()` function,
that returns a readable and writable `Stream` instance which is synchronized with the observable
and can be piped further.


``` js
var ko = require('knockout');
require('ko-stream')(ko); // ‚Üê Extends ko.subscribable.fn

var obs = ko.observable();

someOtherStream.pipe(obs.createStream()).pipe(someOtherStream);

```


Installation
============

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install ko-stream
```
